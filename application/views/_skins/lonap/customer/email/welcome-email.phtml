Dear New LONAP Member,

Firstly, welcome to {$options.identity.orgname}! This is your {$options.identity.name} welcome e-mail.

Please take some time to read this email -- it contains important information concerning your {$options.identity.orgname} membership.

Several sections of this email require your input; these are all clearly marked by the heading "Your Input".  We would appreciate if you could provide us with all the details requested as this will allow us to provide you and other {$options.identity.orgname} members with a better quality of service.


Connection Details
==================

You have opted to connect to {$options.identity.orgname} using {$customer->getVirtualInterfaces()|@count} Ethernet ports.

Unless you have been advised otherwise, you have been assigned an untagged port on the primary peering LAN.

We have assigned the following IP addresses and switch-ports for your exclusive use:

{foreach $customer->getVirtualInterfaces() as $connection}
============================================
Connection {counter name=numconnections}
============================================

LAG Port:        {if $connection->getPhysicalinterfaces()|@count > 1}Yes, comprising of:{else}No{/if}

{foreach $connection->getPhysicalinterfaces() as $pi}
Switch Port:     {$pi->getSwitchPort()->getSwitcher()->getName()}.inex.ie, {$pi->getSwitchPort()->getName()}
Speed:           {$pi->getSpeed()}Mbps
Duplex:          {$pi->getDuplex()}
Location:        {$pi->getSwitchPort()->getSwitcher()->getCabinet()->getLocation()->getName()}
Colo Cabinet ID: {$pi->getSwitchPort()->getSwitcher()->getCabinet()->getName()}

{/foreach}

{foreach $connection->getVlanInterfaces() as $vi}
{assign var='vlanid' value=$vi->getVlan()->getId()}
{$vi->getVlan()->getName()}
---------------------------------------------

{if $vi->getIpv6enabled()}
IPv6 Address:  {$vi->getIPv6Address()->getAddress()}/{$netinfo.$vlanid.6.masklen}
IPv6 Hostname: {$vi->getIpv6hostname()}
{else}
IPv6:          Please contact us at {$options.identity.email} to enable IPv6
{/if}

{if $vi->getIpv4enabled()}
IPv4 Address:  {$vi->getIPv4Address()->getAddress()}/{$netinfo.$vlanid.4.masklen}
IPv4 Hostname: {$vi->getIpv4hostname()}
{else}
IPv4:          Please contact us at {$options.identity.email} to enable IPv4
{/if}

{if not isset( $ipv4md5 )}
    {assign var='ipv4md5' value=$vi->getIpv4bgpmd5secret()}
    {assign var='ipv6md5' value=$vi->getIpv6bgpmd5secret()}
{/if}

{/foreach}

{/foreach}

Your Input
----------

As a matter of policy, {$options.identity.orgname} set all switch ports to auto-neg. Should you require your reverse DNS hostnames changed for either IPv4 or IPv6, please contact {$options.identity.email}.

**If you are connecting to {$options.identity.orgname} via a switch using UTP, you may need to use a cross-over cable on your end.**


Member Portal :: IXP Manager
============================

{$options.identity.orgname} provides a portal for members which provides traffic graphs for your ports, the ability to self-provision some services, the contact and peering details of all other members, a Peering Manager tool, documentation, support information, mailing list subscription management and much more.

Every member is assigned an Administration account with which you then create individual user accounts. The Administration account is only meant for this purpose and as such, all functionality is only available through user accounts.

{if $admins|@count}
We have created your administration account(s) with the following username(s) and email address(es):

{foreach $admins as $a}
  * {$a->getUsername()} <{$a->getEmail()}>
{/foreach}

Please browse to the following page and use the 'Lost Password' facility to set a new password for this account.

{genUrl controller="auth" action="lost-password"}
{else}
Please contact us for your account details at {$options.identity.email}.
{/if}



Route Servers
=============

{$options.identity.orgname} operates a Route Server cluster; this facility allows all members who connect to the cluster to see all routing prefixes sent to the cluster by any other member.  I.e. it provides an quick, safe and easy way to peer with any other route server user.

The {$options.identity.orgname} route server cluster is aimed at:

o  small to medium sized members of the exchange who don't have the time or resources to aggressively manage their peering relationships.

o  larger members of the exchange who have an open peering policy, but where it may not be worth their while managing peering relationships with smaller members of the exchange.

If you don't have any good reasons not to use the route server cluster, you should probably use it.

The service is designed to be reliable. It operates on two physical servers, each located in a different data centre. The service is available on the peering lan, on both ipv4 and ipv6.  The route servers also filter inbound routing prefixes based on published RIPE IRR policies, which means that using the route servers for peering is generally much safer than peering directly with other members.

See {genUrl controller="dashboard" action="rs-info"} for more information.

Your Input
----------

If you wish to use the {$options.identity.orgname} route server system, please email {$options.identity.email} or you can enable the sessions yourself via the IXP Manager.


Your Input
----------

If you want to connect to {$options.identity.orgname} using a cross-connect, you must order it directly from your co-lo / metro ethernet provider and inform {$options.identity.orgname} Operations immediately.  Please ensure that you include full details on the connection type and termination cabinet when ordering the cross-connect from your co-lo provider.

----------


Mailing Lists
=============

To encourage co-operation between {$options.identity.orgname} members, {$options.identity.orgname} provides mailing list services.

Name:                   members@lonap.net
Purpose:                LONAP technical discussion / maintenance announcements
Subscription Policy:    individuals, roles, aliases,
                        no limit per organisation
Distribution:           private

Mailing list subscriptions can be managed via IXP Manager (as explained above) and then browse to the 'Profile' page where you can subscribe to the above and more mailing lists.

----------


LONAP Support
=============

Technical support contact details for LONAP can be found at:

        {genUrl controller="static" action="support"}

In general, the best way to contact LONAP support is by email at: support@lonap.net.  If there is an emergency requiring immediate assistance, please contact one of us on the mobile phones listed on the web page.


Peering
=======

You will find a full list of members on the IXP Manager, along with the correct email addresses to use for peering requests.

When emailing other members about peering requests, please include all technical details relevant to the peering session, including your IP address, your AS number, and an estimate of the number of prefixes you intend to announce to that candidate peer.  Several members require written legal contracts to be signed as a part of their peering procedures.  If you require a written contract, please specify this on your peering request; similarly, it may be often useful to indicate your willingness (or otherwise) to sign legal contracts when approaching other members about peering.

The My Peering Manager tool in the IXP Manager will compose mails with the above details for you automatically.

Please note that LONAP members are required to reply to peering requests within a reasonable time frame.  If your emails to other LONAP members about peering go unanswered, please let us know and we will do what we can.

LONAP requires that all new members peer and share routes with the LONAP route collector for administrative purposes.  We would be obliged if you could set up your router(s) and make the necessary arrangements for this as soon as possible.

LONAP's details are:

remote-as:      AS8330
AS Macro:       AS-LONAP

Peering LAN:
        IPv4 address:       193.203.5.250
        IPv6 address:       2001:7F8:17::208A:1


LONAP currently announces the following prefixes from AS8330:
       
    IPv4:
 
        5.57.80.0/20
        91.198.81.0/24
        193.203.5.0/24
        195.35.120.0/24

    IPv6:

        2001:7F8:17::/48

NOC Details
===========

For the convenience of its members, LONAP maintains a list of NOC and peering contact details for its members.  These details are held on a private LONAP database, and are available only from the IXP Manager on the following URL:

        {genUrl controller="customer" action="details"}

This area of the LONAP website is password protected and SSL secured. Passwords are only provided to current LONAP members.  This information is considered private and will not be passed on to other third parties by LONAP.

We would appreciate if you could take the time to ensure that the following details we hold on file are correct:

Your Input
----------

Member name:                    {$customer->getName()}
Primary corporate web page:     {$customer->getCorpwww()}

Router Configuration
====================

If you are new to internet exchanges, we would ask you to note that all members are expected to adhere to the technical requirements of the LONAP MoU.  In particular, we would draw your attention to these requirements which outline what types of traffic may and may not be forwarded to the LONAP peering LAN.

For Cisco IOS based routers, we recommend the following interface configuration commands:

 no ip redirects
 no ip proxy-arp
 no ip directed-broadcast
 no mop enabled
 no cdp enable
 udld port disable

If you intend to use IPv6 with a Cisco IOS based router, please also consider the following interface commands:

 no ipv6 redirects
 ipv6 nd suppress-ra


Connecting Switches to LONAP 
============================

Many members choose to connect their LONAP port to a layer 2 switch and then forward their peering traffic to a router virtual interface hosted elsewhere on their network.  While connecting layer 2 switches to the LONAP peering LAN is not actively discouraged, incorrect configuration can cause serious and unexpected connectivity problems.

The primary concern is to ensure that only traffic from the router subinterface is presented to the LONAP port. LONAP implements per port mac address counting: if more than 1 mac address is seen on any switch port at any time, that port will automatically be disabled for a cooling off period, and your connectivity to LONAP will temporarily be lost.

This policy prevents two potential problems: firstly, it ensures that layer 2 traffic loops are prevented and secondly, it ensures that no other traffic escapes to the LONAP peering LAN which shouldn't be seen there.

If you choose to connect your LONAP port or ports to a switch, it is critically important to assign one unique vlan for each LONAP connection.  If you share an LONAP facing VLAN between multiple LONAP ports or share a LONAP-facing VLAN with any other network, your connection will automatically be shut down due to the security mechanisms implemented by LONAP.

Please also note that by default, several switch models send link-local traffic to all ports.  On Cisco switches, this can be disabled using the following interface commands:

interface GigabitEthernetx/x
 spanning-tree bpdufilter enable
 no keepalive
 no cdp enable
 udld port disable

For further details please see the following URL:

        {genUrl controller="static" action="switches"}


PeeringDB
=========

PeeringDB ( http://www.peeringdb.com/ ) facilitates the exchange of information related to peering. Specifically, what networks are peering, where they are peering, and if they are likely to peer with you.

More and more organisations are using PeeringDB to make decisions on where they should open POPs, provision new links, etc.

We would very much appreciate it if you could mark your new LONAP peering under the "Public Peering Locations" section of your PeeringDB page. We are listed as 'LONAP'. If you do not yet have a PeeringDB account, we would suggest that you register for one on their site.
