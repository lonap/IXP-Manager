Potential Todo / Feature Ideas
------------------------------

* "the peer2peer stats page does not scale well for networks with many peers.  
  I think it could be an idea to make it configurable if you want the
  actual graphs or just a list where you can select which graphs you would
  like to see in one view"

* <nick-2128> you know what would be incredibly useful? an ixpmanager.php 
  file which bleated about whether the correct modules are installed or not

* Review MRTG script for reseller and fanout ports

* Fix static documentation to allow for auth. See StaticController::__call()

* INEX require that members peer "with at least the greater of 4 other
  Members, or 10% of other Members". A tool to list members failing this
  requirement would be useful.

* Email members on >80% of port utilisation

* Show who a member peers with (or not) on the overview page

* Show if a member is on the route server or not

* Member audit - port states, errors / discards, route collector session
  status, route server session status, etc.


* Go through application/config/application.ini.dist and fix FIXMEs and add new
  documentation where indicated

* Would be useful to display last login information in the user edit screen or 
  the list of users. Also the created by, last updated date?

* Member field for "MD5 Required" with values: "No", "Yes - mandatory", 
  "Yes - on request", "Unknown"

* Show per-member peering matrix on member overview page? 

* Member health report

* Allow member to modify template that Request Peering email is populated 
  with when sending invite using "Peering Manager". Ideally there could be a
  list of predefined variables available that could be used while templating 
  email (ie. peer name, peer ASN, own name, own ASN, own WWW, common peering 
  LAN IPs, AS MACRO, peering email, NOC email and so on), so member could 
  create own template using above variables + own text.

* Add integrated PeeringDB functionality via access to:
  mysql -h mysql.peeringdb.com  

* Add PeeringDB link to PM request template

* Update suggested prefix limit / real prefix limit based on IRRDB entries?

* Tool to plug data into EURO-IX database

* Add "Abbrieviated Name" to schema for titles in, e.g., p2p graphs

* Add ASN to graph titles

* Multiple P2P graphs for LAG ports

* "hose that you have bilateral peerings with is the difference between the 
  'Peers' tab and the 'Potential Bilateral Peers' tab. But I'll add a note 
  to add a tab that also shows this."
